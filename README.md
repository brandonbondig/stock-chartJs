## What can it do?
This webapp visualizes stock data as well as the securities most common indicators, it gives you the option to change variables, such as: Different indicators, indicator periods and stock timelines. I have added a navbar to the right of the page, that i haven't configured. But thats up for the imagination.

## disclaimer
This webapp is fully made with Vue.js as a fun project, you can use any component or section of code as you'd like.
